Firmware required to boot & operate the [apertusÂ° AXIOM Beta Camera](https://www.apertus.org/axiom-beta).  
Detailed instructions on how to use the Firmware & opertate the camera can be found in the [wiki](https://wiki.apertus.org/index.php/AXIOM_Beta/Manual)

## Download Nightly Firmware
If you want to experiment with the latest changes and dont mind, when the camera isnt working, you [try use the untested nightly firmware images](INSTALL.md).

## Building & hacking around
A great way to start hacking on the Beta Frimware is building it.
Build instructions can be found in the [`makefiles/README.md`](makefiles/README.md) file.
There you will also find instructions for running the firmware inside qemu for development purposes.

## Structure of this Repository
The Repository is divided in the following Parts:

### `software/`
Linux user-space tools and scripts used to operate the AXIOM Beta hardware.

### `gateware/`
Contains the VHDL sources for the various Programmable Logic devices on the board. (Currently not everything is contained)

### `boot/`
Files needed in the boot process.


### `makefiles/`
Contains all the other stuff that is needed for creating a Beta firmware image.
